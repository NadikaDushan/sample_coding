## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
require(dslabs)
data("gapminder")
require(ggplot2)
require(dplyr)

gapminder %>% filter(year %in% c(1960,2010)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fertility,life_expectancy,col=continent)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(.~year)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
